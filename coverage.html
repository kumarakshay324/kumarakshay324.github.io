					<h2 style="font-size:40px;font-weight: 500">COVERAGE PROBLEM IN MOBILE ROBOTICS</h2>
				<br>


				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">Mobile robots are very often supposed to move around the deployment area and
				complete certain tasks in specific locations of the area. Such problems where the robot
				is supposed to navigate to an arbitrary location in the pre-fed map and complete a task
				based on the tool to be used, is called a coverage problem. <b>​Figure 1</b> shows such a
				setup where the robot has a map for the environment, a warehouse in this case; and it
				is supposed to traverse to the area from any random start point and navigate the area
				according to the tool and task</p>

				<h1 style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;font-size:20px; ">Introduction</h1>
				<br>

				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">Mobile robots are the driving force of the warehouses and factories. Such robots are
				required to complete tasks ranging from transporting goods ro routine patrolling. All
				these tasks are essentially to be completed autonomously with little to no interference of
				humans involved. Thus, the robot needs to make decisions in real-time, on its behavior
				while also planning to act upon the repercussions of the probabilistic effects that its
				current action has on the future. To delineate the previous statement, consider that the
				robot knows that it is supposed to be travelling straight to get to a target point and
				suddenly meets an obstacle. In such cases, the robot needs to decide if it should
				change its path to come back to the originally planned straight path or if shall compute a
				new path to the trajectory - depending upon which of them is computationally/otherwise
				expensive or not.
				In coverage problems, the robot faces similar issues where it is supposed to act
				considering the task it is doing, the tool it is using, the start and end locations fed to it
				and the utility constraints(time, fuel used, sensing limitations etc.)

				<br><br>

				This report discusses the complete approach to deduce methodologies for such tasks
				that has contingency plans and tries to be inclusive of all the possible scenarios that the
				robot may run into. ​The further sections of the this document cover Robot
				Localization techniques, Coverage Area Decomposition techniques, Coverage
				Area Navigation techniques. </p>

				<br>
				<h1 style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;font-size:20px ">Robot Localization</h1>
				<br>
				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">
				The ability of robot to recognize its current positioning in the map is of utmost
				importance as it determines any further action. It is the most important step for any
				mobile robot before it does any movement. If the robot fails to localize itself
				deterministically, it can try probabilistic techniques with cues from several small motions
				to finally determine its global position in the map. Knowledge about current position and
				orientation with reference to the global origin helps it to refer to landmarks in the map for
				assistance in navigation and task completion. <b>​Figure 2</b> shows the general approach to
				mobile robot localization. <br><br> The techniques for robot localization include:</p>

				</center>

				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px "> Probabilistic Techniques  </li>
				<br>	
				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:220px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">
				Such techniques generally draw a probable distribution of robot positioning on the map
				and then further reduce it down to deterministic values using sensor and trial
				movements. All probabilistic techniques depend upon inputs from ​perception ​model ​(
				robot’s idiothetic sources tell it about its own motion, proprioception and robot’s
				allothetic sources tell it about the world - camera, lidar and laser sensors ) and ​action
				model ​(like odometry information and wheel revolution based distance covered - subject
				to errors accrued over time)</p>

				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:250px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> <i> <b>Markov Localization</b></i> </p>

				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:250px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> In this technique, the robot starts with an arbitrarily defined probability distribution
				of the robot’s position on the map over discrete positions and updates these beliefs over
				time., The prior probabilities are updated using sensor data like encoder values and
				laser scans and given it the conditions to discard or support probabilities over the
				locations. The process of keeping track of probabilities over the complete map, for all
				discretized possible locations, and re-computing probabilities over all of them makes the
				process computationally expensive but still helpful as it addresses all the possibilities.
				The perception model is used to individually update all probabilities over the possible
				locations using Bayes formula. It could work for both, topological as well as grid maps,
				but given the generality of the algorithm, it tends to be very inefficient.</p>

				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:250px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> <i> <b>Kalman Localization</b></i> </p>

				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:250px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> This method considers the robot’s possible location on the map as a single
				Gaussian probability distribution where the mean and covariance values are repeatedly
				updated to get to the best representation of its pose. Kalman Localization works on
				using the transition model, that is the robot’s <b></b> ​action model that updates its likelihood
				factors and the plant model that is the ​perception model ​that gives another estimate of
				the future pose in the map. It combines information from the two to get final localization
				values. The prediction step works on movement prior movement information to predict
				new locations and then the same is estimated via the sensors that see the environment;
				finally culminating the update by fusing the two information.<br><br>

				An example to this could be that the robot starts with a random Gaussian belief of its
				position, takes a small move, records this to predict new position with the existing
				Gaussian belief, then uses sensors to view the surroundings (distance from the edges
				of the maps and relative position to certain landmarks on the map) and estimate its
				location on the map and finally using the two hypotheses to find a better Gaussian
				probability representation. This iterative techniques terminates when further updates
				make the probabilities to converge and the resultant distribution shows where the robot
				could best be in the map. Very often, the high-class sensing systems help make this
				distribution deterministic with a very narrow region of uncertainty.</p>

				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px "> Landmark based Localization  </li>
				<br>	
				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:220px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">
				Another category of localization could scenario where the environment is customized for
				robot navigation. These cases include easy to sense RFID tags on the floor or shelves
				of a warehouse, visual landmark coding that represents the corresponding position on
				the map or otherwise. Such practices are fairly simple but obviously not efficient to be
				duplicated under time and money constraints. Beacon systems, artificial floor markers
				and GPS based location estimation are also examples of the same. The robot
				processes such highly informative tags and compares it with a pre-fed look-up table for
				the same and finds the best match of the location, deterministically on most of the
				occasion.</p>

				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px "> Computer Vision based Localization  </li>
				<br>	
				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:220px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">
				Use of visual feed could be incorporated in both of the above techniques but using
				machine vision explicitly to explore the environment while tracking own motion, building
				an own version of the map and then trying to fit this generated map to a subset of the
				global map can also be used.
				In our approach to solving the coverage problem, localization is the first step that
				determines robot’s motion. It is followed by methods to reach and decompose the
				arbitrary coverage area into units and reduce the complexity of the task.</p>

				<h1 style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;font-size:20px ">Coverage Area Decomposition Techniques</h1>
				<br>
				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">
				The coverage area for the task could be any arbitrary section, either continuous or
				sporadically distributed over the complete map. This makes robot understand the
				complexity of the task and reduce it to simpler individually addressable sections. 
				<br><br> The complex scenarios for coverage areas could be:</p> 


				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> The area is not a perfect polygon with standard angles on the edges. User inputs
				using haptic devices and other manual inputs devices or using drawing tools
				could form very inconsistent edges and angles. A comparative version of
				standard computationally defined coverage area and a manual-input defined
				coverage area is shown in ​<b>Figure 3 </b>  </li>
				<br>	

				<center>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/coverage/f3.png" style="width:435px;height:273px;">
					    <figcaption>Figure 3 - Coverage Area With Irregular Boundaries</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<br><br>
				</center>

				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> The coverage area includes voids in centers and demands robot motion in a way
				that the robot should eventually find a way out of the area, doesn’t get stuck in it.
				An example of such scenario can also be seen in <b>​Figure 4</b> </li>
				<br>	


				<center>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/coverage/f4.png" style="width:435px;height:273px;">
					    <figcaption>Figure 4 - Coverage Area With voids within</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<br><br>
				</center>

				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> The coverage area is discontinuous and distributed all over the map and the
				robot needs to determine the optimal strategy where incorrect sequence of
				handling the zones could trap the robot. An example of this special problem is
				shown in <b>Figure 5</b> ​. Here the blue strips are to be painted and the robot starts at
				one edge of the map which is its docking zone. The robot could instantly start
				painting but would end up in trapped on the other end of the map. So, it should
				understand that even though travelling to other end of the and then starting to
				paint involves more work, it prevents chances of getting trapped with no rescue
				options.</li>

					    <figcaption>Figure 5 - Coverage Area with Discontinuities</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<br><br>
				</center>

				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> The coverage zones are smaller than the robot footprint and navigation to such
				zones has only one approach. Such a problem could be seen in ​ <b>Figure 6</b> ​.</li>
				<br>

					</figure>

					<br><br>
				</center>



				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">
				All such special problems of coverage firstly need the robot to have a clear
				understanding of the mapping information and then start the decomposition into viable,
				individually approachable zones.
				<br><br> The different mapping techniques include:</p>

				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> Metric or Topological maps where the complete area is placed on a 2D
				coordinate frame and any point in the area is mapped with a particular position in
				the frame, either using cartesian or polar representation. While Cartesian
				presentation helps represent discrete points, polar representation helps in
				comparing robot’s current heading and distance with respect to origin with that of
				the target and thus aligns with navigation tasks’ necessities</li>
				<br>				 

				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> Grid based maps are where the complete are is divided into several square grids
				of predefined size, generally equal to the robot footprint. Since areas need not be
				perfectly rectangular and thus can’t have finite grids; the smaller sections are
				represented as a part of the grid with smaller sections of varying granularity that
				cover all tiny zones.</li>
				<br>				 

				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">Certain maps could also be built to overlay on the standard maps. Such a
				representation would be having the distances between landmarks as certain
				nodes on the map while the obstacle free path between them represents a
				traversable path called an arc. </li>
				<br>				 

				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;">
				Based on the mapping used, the robot needs to identify the best decomposition of the
				coverage area such that each smaller version is individually addressable and it
				encompasses the complete coverage area without missing zones. Following techniques
				are proposed to reduce the coverage area into simpler accessible zones.</p>

				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> <b>Boustrophedon Decomposition</b></p>
				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> Here, the complete map is subdivided into several parallel strips that can be covered
				using the zig-zag motion that covers area equal to the width of the robot footprint. This
				eases out robot’s motion in each individual strip as it simply supposed to cover each
				strip once and that zone of the coverage area is worked upon.
				However, this is easily applicable easily to polygonal areas with right-angled edges no
				awkwardly angled edges exist on the strip. ​Figure 7 shows a comparative illustration of
				where this decomposition would work or where it might not work.</li>
				<br>				 

				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> <b>Trapezoidal Decomposition</b></p>
				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> Just like the above decomposition, here we could use trapezoidal shapes to divided the
				coverage area into simpler zones that can be traversed using the zig-zag motion.
				However, this tends to create several unnecessary smaller sections that could have
				been essentially merged and used in the above technique.</li>
				<br>				 

				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> <b>Rectangular sub-sections with grids of variable granularity for remaining zones of non-standard dimensions - A subclass of Boustrophedon Decomposition</b></p>
				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> As the heading suggest, we try to break the coverage area into large unoccupied with
				obstacle zones that can be covered easily by the robot’s sweeping or cyclic motion(to
				be discussed later). It is tried that such sections’ edges align with the polygonal edges
				and the broken zones allow traversal with between adjacent ones. There should exist a
				path that connects adjacent sections</li>
				<br>				 

				<p style="column-width:1000px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> <b>4. Random zones for random motion</b></p>
				<li style="text-align:left;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:justify;"> This is the easiest technique to be implemented in coverage problems where the map is
				divided into random zones or shapes larger than the robot footprint and the robot could
				make random sweeps within each of them. Theoretically, as time tends to infinity(very
				large time span of operation), all points would have been covered. This technique is the
				most extravagant one and just a theoretical approach to improve upon.</li>
